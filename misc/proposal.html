                            to positive pressure and the many methods that were developed over time.<br><br>The reasoning behind our topic is that we wanted to focus our attention to 
                            investigate the different health impacts on a person a ventilator has as the 
                            technology and methodologies have changed over time. We also wanted to explore 
                            the overall benefits, drawbacks, opportunities, and risks that have been taken to get
