        <h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>
        <p>Ventilators have allowed for great opportunities for people in society and the technology itself. To grasp a full understanding on this matter we have to date back to 1928 which was when the iron lung was developed. It was developed by two doctors, Dr Philip Drinker and Dr Louis Agassiz Shaw, it was originally developed to help those suffering from polio to breath better <a href="references.html#ref1">(Dhawan N. 2020)</a>. The iron lung worked as a negative pressure ventilator which meant the patients entire body had to be sealed in the chamber for the machine to work. Most things were fine with the iron lung till 1952, when polio had struck Copenhagen. Hospitals wererunning low on iron lung machines to use compared to all the patients they had, it was then that a doctor named Bjorn Ibsen urged Lassen, whom was the hospital’s chief physician at the time to perform tracheostomy and use positive pressure instead of negative pressure. With tracheostomy performed but without the ventilators we have today, many nurses and students had to help these patients breathe by manually hand bagging them, this was a period of very intense labour as they spent a total of 165,000 hours helping them. Using this newfound method of positive pressure ventilation, it proved successful as the mortality rate from polio had dropped from about 90% to less than 25% <a href="references.html#ref2">(Barr, Doroshow & Montgomery, 2020)</a>.</p>

        <h4>Opportunities for Ventilators</h4>
        <p>With positive pressure proven to be a successful and efficient way of treating patients it has since become the standard, it has also paved the way for technological advancements to bring us to where we are today. Ventilators have become more and more sophisticated than what the iron lung was, with most of them being driven by computers and way more compact, this opens a new door where it enhances the ease of use for nurses and doctors but also enhances the experience of the patient. Through the five conventional ventilations modes which are volume assist/control; pressure assist/control; pressure support ventilation; volume synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV); and pressure SIMV <a href="references.html#ref3">(Lei Y. 2017)</a>, it allows ease of use for the physician as there are pre-set modes which they can also fine tune base on the patient’s needs, allowing the patient to have the best experience possible compared to the iron lungs which in a way have only one mode and very little control.</p> 
        <p>Although ventilators are at a very complex level, they can always improve, one avenue which ventilators can take for further development could be the implementation of artificial intelligence or working in unison with other medical devices. If this was the case and mechanical ventilators would be developed with artificial intelligence, it would ease the use of the machine and improve the users experience, it could even detect any abnormalities in breathing patterns from the pressure support ventilation mode which could notify doctors or nurses of events that could happen before it either takes place or becomes too serious. Currently most medical devices found within hospitals work individually ventilators included and, require a human to set and adjust the machine, these devices also require a human to interpret the data gathered from the patient.</p>
        <p>With the number of patients that use ventilators around the world, there are copious amounts of data that is being thrown away after a few seconds. Instead of discarding the data we could collect it and train an AI for their breathing patterns then detect if there are any abnormalities. When a patient is hooked up to a ventilator, it would gather the data and directly send that data to the AI system which would then process the information instantly and send back micro adjustments to best optimise the experience <a href="references.html#ref4">(Gholami, Haddad & Bailey, 2018)</a>. This could be a crucial step to ensure that every patient has the best care they can receive and not everyone can be monitored at the same time however, some ethical issues may arise with the mining of data to train and use the AI.</p>

        <h4>Opportunities for Society</h4>
        <p>Another opportunity presented through the advancement of ventilators is to people in society. It is and will be used in many applications like, treating infants, those in surgery, and patients with respiratory illnesses. With the advancement from the iron lung, it has become more widely available to those that need it, ranging from a basic at home ventilator to those found in hospital’s intensive care units. These ventilators allowed society to perform more complex and life saving surgeries, keeping the oxygen flowing through their bodies more efficiently and less damaging in the long run. But in recent times ventilators are being used to treat those badly affected by Covid-19, it has helped them breathe whilst they were recovering.</p>
        <p>Another crucial application of ventilators is using them in your own homes. In a survey conducted by <a href="references.html#ref5">Lloyd Ownen (2005)</a> in Europe between July 2001 and June 2002, it was found that 483 centres were treating about 27,118 home mechanical ventilation users. Even though that figure may seem small, it’s still a significant of people which rely on ventilators outside of the hospital in Europe. You could just image now, 20 years later how many more people are relying on ventilators around the world, it just goes to show that it has really had a huge impact on society. Another example would be sleep apnoea, it is estimated that about 936 million people worldwide suffer from sleep apnoea, if a person starts to develop or has serve sleep apnoea it could lead to serious health risk <a href="references.html#ref6">(Benjafield et al., 2019)</a>. Having a personal home ventilator is what that person would need to help reduce the effects of sleep apnoea. It was only from the iron longs that we could develop all these types of ventilators which benefit society.</p>
