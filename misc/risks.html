        <h1>Technology Risks</h1>
        <h4>Risks that respiratory system bring to society</h4>
        <p>Although modern day respiratory system is very useful, and the pros outweigh the cons due to the sheer amount of people that struggle with breathing because of many health conditions present in society such as asthma, lung infections, stokes, pneumonia etc. Along with the fact that these machines can save lives, they also come with potential risks and medical side effects. Of these side effects and risk are, infections, irritations, blood clots, lung injuries and more.</p>
        <h4>Some examples of medical issues that come along with the use of this technology</h4>
        <p>With the use of a ventilator one the main and most common risks that can present itself is infections, which can build up in your lungs. Using a breathing tube in addition to the ventilator, this can open the patient up to germs building up in windpipe and throat, these germs which come in the form of mucus and fluid can travel into the persons lungs, which can greatly increase the risk of developing certain infection such as a sinus infection or pneumonia. This infection can be fought by using antibiotics, but the use of drugs can lead to even more health problems on top of the ones the patient might be experiencing.</p>
        <p>The same fluid that was a part of the problem of building up germs in your throat and windpipe, can also lead to a health issue named pulmonary edema, which is when the air sacs in your lungs get filled up with fluids, resulting the body to struggle to receive oxygen which eventually leads to the patient having side effects such as shortness of breath.</p>
        <p>A lot of the time when using a ventilator, the patient, is static and staying in the same position for a long amount of time, this caused in a handful of situations for the patient to have disorders become present in their nerves and muscles. Due to the lack of breathing own their own, this leads to a massive loss of muscle memory which can lead to the impairments of some of these muscles and nerves, this could cause the patient to possibly have difficulty breathing by themselves after they are taken off. Along with these problems also came the overwhelming possibility that a blood clot could form from the lack of movement, which would present the patient with even more health problems then they already have.</p>
        <p>These ventilators although they are helping to work in place of your lungs, they can also cause injury to a patient’s lungs. In a certain situation such as where too much air pressure is in the lungs, or if the oxygen amount inside the lungs is too much resulting in a toxic amount of oxygen, or even if the air leaks into spaces where it shouldn’t be present such as between the lungs and chest wall, can lead to some sort of injury to the patient’s lungs. These lung injuries can cause more health issues such as shortness of breath etc. just like the other risks mentioned before. All of which are on top of the original medical issue that patient was being treated for using the ventilator.</p>
        <p>Although the physical risk of respiratory assistance is bad in modern times, back in the 20th century where the use of negative pressure ventilators such as iron lung was still present, the mental health of the patients that required respiratory help were not considered for. Back in the 1950’s where a rise of the disease polio was present, one man by the name of Paul Alexander who contracted this disease was set in an iron lung, he speaks about his experience in an article from The Guardian where he expressed the 18 months that he had to spend in the machine were “torture”, he even mentioned that he had to lay in his own waste for hours since “he couldn’t tell the staff he needed to be cleaned”. There was also another case which was discovered in the 1940s that was leaning towards the conclusions that one of the iron lungs had failed to work as intended, it states that the research conducted “implies that this technology failed to remove adequate quantities of carbon dioxide”, which could have caused many acid-base imbalances and worse death. The health issues present with the majority of people using the iron lung, plus the conditions that they had to experience can be concluded, to show that they not only had to risk giving their body up to a piece of technology that could easily fail, but that they also had experienced severe damage to their mental health, during and after their time in the iron lung.</p>
        <p>Ventilators are an important piece of technology in the medical industry, they can be lifesaving and an important part of a treatment for people of all ages. Although they are revolutionary and help millions of lives every day, they come with many risks. Once the use of one is complete, your previous problem might be solved, but there is chance/risk a new problem might be presented to you once you leave the ventilators use.</p>
