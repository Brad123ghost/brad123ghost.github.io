                <h1>Technology Choices</h1>
                <p>When it comes to medical respiratory assistance, ventilators are the primary choice as they can act as an artificial lung or breathing gateway to replace any malfunctioning or unavailable processes that are necessary for the respiratory system to function properly. In most cases, ventilators directly push air in and out of the body through pressure manipulation from a machine that connects directly to the patient. Respiratory failure is almost always considered a life-threatening emergency where the bodies critical organs don’t get the amount of oxygen necessary to function properly. Respiratory failure has a number of different causes such as; Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), head injury (or a stroke), asthma, cardiac arrest, drug overdose, Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, sepsis, lung diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), or other conditions/diseases that affect nerves and/or muscles that are involved in breathing including anesthesia that is provided during surgeries according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute <a href="references.html#ref12">(NHLBI, 2022a)</a>.<p><br>
                <p>Ventilators themselves are complex machines that allow for multiple types of adjustments that are made case by case depending on the patient’s condition and its severity. Adjustments to amount of pressure and timing are the most common as the amount of oxygen needed for the patient or the pace of their breathing needs to be controlled. For cases where a patient has temporary difficulty breathing, the ventilators pressure can be slowly reduced over time to allow for the patient’s ability to breath themselves to recovery while still having the support as they recover <a href="references.html#ref14">(NHLBI, 2022c)</a>. There are also portable versions of ventilators that can allow the patient to move around or be used at home (if the condition is untreatable and long term). These ventilators can vary in their use for either constant ventilation, occasional ventilation (maybe during the night) or if a patient does not need routine ventilation and just needs accessible in case of emergency <a href="references.html#ref16">(Shephard Center, n.d.)</a>.</p><br>
                <h4>Use Via Intubation and Tracheostomy</h4>
                <p>For serious conditions where a mask is not enough, a breathing tube can be placed in a patient’s windpipe through the nose or mouth and allows the machine to blow air directly into the airway, this is called intubation. Conditions where this becomes necessary are normally related the airway being blocked or damaged such as airway obstruction, cardiac arrest, possible neck/abdomen/chest injuries, or other, more serious cases of disease or surgery <a href="references.html#ref9">Cleveland Medical Clinic, 2021)</a>. If a patient needs to be on ventilation long term, then a tracheostomy can be performed. A tracheostomy is a surgery where a tube is placed directly into the windpipe through a hole made in the neck. This provides an even more direct method of ventilation to the airways as well as well as being more comfortable than intubation for patients who need the ventilation long term <a href="references.html#ref13">(NHLBI, 2022b)</a>.</p><br>
                <h4>Use Via Masks</h4>
                <p>For less serious cases or, where intubation or tracheostomy is unavailable, ventilators are used with fittest mask that help push the air from the machine into the patient’s mouth and through to their lungs. It also uses some pressure to keep the airways open if necessary. This is the most used as it is easy to apply to a patient in emergency situations as well as being much more comfortable for the patient for short term or less serious conditions such as those caused by disease, asthmatic attacks, loss of consciousness <a href="references.html#ref11">(Robert C Hyzy & Jakob I McSparron, 2022)</a>.</p><br>
                <p>One slight alternative to the more commonly used mechanical or pressure-based ventilators is a bag-valve-mask ventilation with uses a self-inflating bag is mostly for very short-term/emergency situations where ventilation is required immediately or as an interim method as the more complex but reliable methods are being prepared <a href="references.html">(Habrat, 2021)</a>.</p><br>
                <h4>Other Treatments</h4>
                <p>In some cases, it helps for the patient to have other medical treatment alongside the primary use of ventilators, but most require at least the support ventilators or its short-term use to allow for initial recovery. Example of these treatment could be medication for some diseases or disorders like asthma, pneumonia, heart problems, etc., surgery or therapy for physical trauma or some operable/curable conditions <a href="references.html#ref15">(NHLBI, 2022d)</a>.</p>
