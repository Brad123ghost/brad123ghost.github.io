                <h3>Reflection/Ethical</h3>
                <p>Respiratory assistant technology has always been useful throughout its evolution and development.
                Only a few problems arise when the ethicality of the technology is questioned, ventilators now a
                days are present in most hospitals around the world, but in the present with all that’s going on with
                covid-19, ICU ventilators are in shortage at hospitals. This is caused by the grand number of patients
                that require ventilators due to the current pandemic, plus the fact that ICU ventilators are
                manufactured by big companies resulting in the piece of technology being too expensive for many
                hospitals, the majority of which are located in developing countries. Although the price of these
                advanced pieces of technology are in some way a fair price for the amount of demand there is and
                cost of building them, it is ethically and morally wrong to exclude many developing countries from
                the assistance of these lifesaving machines. This same issue of money vs health comes up
                throughout the whole industry of health, including in the 20th industry where the polio victims only
                chance of living was with the assistance of the breathing apparatus present at their time, which was
                the iron lung. Although the iron long was large and very expensive, it saved the lives of thousands of
                patients suffering the effects of Polio. This issue has been present for a long time, and currently
                there are people working on a cheaper and more long terms version of these machines to help fight
                the current pandemic, but until these advances are complete it will be the lively hood and health of
                people living in underdeveloped countries that will suffer from the time it takes to evolve and
                develop these new respiratory machines.</p>
