                <h3>Reflection/Ethical</h3>
                <p>There are many significant opportunities, risk, and choices regarding ventilators. Ventilators have developed immensely from the past two centuries, they have become widely available and most importantly portable compared to the iron lung, this has greatly impacted the overall health for society as it’s aiding in the recovery process. Opportunities for where the technology can further develop would be implementing artificial intelligence, this would allow the patient to have the best experience however, there would be an ethical issue of mining the patient’s data, an example of this would be our online footprint. Some people don’t mind having their data online whilst others do, having privacy is everyone’s human rights but there are various companies which sell and mine data thus our online footprints grow bigger and bigger even if we don’t know. Similarly with the data of the patient, it’s feeding a computer to train the system, and some may consider this very intrusive of their own personal data. Since society has moved away from iron lungs, they have become more portable and there are many more choices when it comes to ventilators, a common one would be mechanical home ventilators. Sleep apnoea affects nearly 1 billion people in the world however, there wouldn’t be that many ventilators for everyone, even if there was enough there would be a dilemma of personal health vs money. Ventilators are not cheap and at what cost are we putting our health at, some people that need ventilators may not be able to afford them, thus their health will decline faster than someone who has access to them. If you were to get one supplied through the government there probably will be a huge waitlist, which could end badly for those that really need them. With the iron lung that would have been some ethical issues regarding them as your whole body had to be sealed in the chamber which would have meant you were imprisoned, whereas now there will be a lot more freedom as to where you would be using the ventilators.</p><br>
                <p>From the research we have done on this topic I think that that ventilator should be available for those that can’t afford them, this could be done by making them cheaper through governments paying some of the price. I would also agree that AI could incorporate some issues regarding personal data however if the data is not stored or used for AI it could at least communicate with other machines that which provide an overall better experience for the patient.</p>
