                <h3>Reflection/Ethical</h3>
                <p>Some ethical issues relating to our technology can include the potential for future AI control of Respiratory systems that would require data collection from a large selection of patients to help teach/guide the AI to be able to control the ventilators pressure, speed, and other configurations to accurately reflect what the patient needs. This data collection would be difficult as most patients would likely not consent for their data to be recorded and used for research that is not directly relevant to helping them and collecting respiratory information from patients without them knowing would be highly unethical as it breaches the right of privacy the patient has as this data would be sent to a third-party company that is creating the AI.</p>
