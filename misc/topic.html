        <h1>Chosen Technology/Topic</h1>
        <p>There have been many technological advancements in the medical field from the past two centuries. We will be focusing on the piece of technology known as ventilators. Ventilators have been around for a long time since the 19th century, however, weren’t fully used till the mid-20th century. The image around ventilators has changed drastically. The first instances of a ventilator weren’t the most human friendly as it was durable and built to outlast the people using them. Currently ventilators have evolved massively, we are currently producing the most complex, versatile, and advanced ventilators out there. These machines are being used daily to help people acquire the respiratory assistance needed, whether it’s to help patients with disease, or viruses like Covid-19 who have difficulty breathing or, to support breathing during general anaesthesia for surgeries. We want to focus our attention to investigate the different health impacts on society a ventilator has as the technology and methodologies have change over time.</p>
